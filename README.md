## Language Support
The user interface of the application, as well as the data fetched from the API, are available exclusively in the Polish language. The entire application is localized to cater to Polish-speaking users, offering them a seamless and immersive experience while exploring the world of wild animals.

## Note

Currently, the API provides only a limited set of animal data. However, I am actively working on expanding the collection and will be adding more animal species in the future.
